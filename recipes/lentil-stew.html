    <h1>Lentil Stew</h1>
    <p>Lentil stew is a thick lentil soup made with the legumes as its base. Often a vegan or vegetarian recipe, this gluten-free stew is low in total fat and includes good carbohydrates and an abundance of protein. Although lentil stew is uncomplicated to make and doesnt necessarily require a long cooking time, its flavors become richer the longer it simmers—for example, over a long period on the stovetop or in a slow cooker.</p>
        <h4><u><ul>Ingredients</u></h4>
            <li>1-2 tbsp light olive oil for sauté</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 large carrot, washed and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 stick celery, finely chopped</li>
            <li>8 oz mushrooms, finely sliced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp low-sodium tamari sauce </li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup puy or green lentils (dried)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red wine, or sub veggie broth</li>
            <li>1 14 oz can diced tomatoes (or passata/whole crushed tomatoes)</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable broth, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pine nuts (optional)</li>
            <li>4 servings gluten-free pasta or sub quinoa/brown rice</li>
            <li>2 tbsps fresh basil (garnish)</li>
            <li>1 avocado (diced, garnish)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <ol><h4><u>Steps</u></h4>
            <li>Ideally, slice and expose your mushrooms to sunlight for a few hours (up to 6) before cooking to optimise vitamin D (see info on reverse!)</li>
            <li>Also, soak the lentils for a few hours prior to cooking. Drain and rinse well. This reduces enzyme inhibitors and increases nutrient bioavailability.  </li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots and celery. Sauté for 3-5 minutes, until the onion starts to turn translucent. </li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms and continue cooking for about 5 minutes. Add the tamari sauce, garlic and lentils and cook for another minute, stirring frequently. It will start to smell amazing!</li>
            <li>Add the wine and cook for a minute until most of it has evaporated. Then add in the tomatoes, vegetable broth, tomato paste, bay leaf, thyme, paprika and salt. Stir to combine and bring it to a boil. Reduce it to a simmer, cover the pan and cook for 30 to 35 minutes until the lentils are tender (if you soaked the lentils this may take less time.)</li>
            <li>If the sauce becomes too thick, add more veggie broth, water or wine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Remove the bay leaf at the end and stir in the pine nuts (optional).</li>
            <li>Start to cook the pasta in a large pot of salted water according to package instructions around 15 minutes before the sauce is done. Once the pasta is al dente, drain the cooking water and toss in a little bit of olive oil (optional, to prevent from sticking). Quinoa or brown rice work well too.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta (or quinoa/rice) with the mushroom and lentil ragu and garnish with fresh basil. The chopped avocado is optional but a really delicious addition. If you’re not vegan, you could add chopped, lean English-cut bacon (ask our butchers for a recommendation.) <i>Enjoy!</i></li>
